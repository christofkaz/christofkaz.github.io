        <p>I developed this quiz game web app using mainly JustPy. That way, I was able to build both the frontend and backend of the app with just Python code.</p>
        <p>The purpose behind this project was to hone my knowledge with Python's OOP and its more advanced functions </p>
        <p>All the quiz data in the project is being requested via an API</p>
